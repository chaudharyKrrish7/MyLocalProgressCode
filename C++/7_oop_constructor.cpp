//A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.

// To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ():
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Car {        // The class
  public:          // Access specifier
    string brand;  // Attribute
    string model;  // Attribute
    int year;      // Attribute
    Car(string x, string y, int z) { // Constructor with parameters
      brand = x;
      model = y;
      year = z;
    }
};

int main() {
  // Create Car objects and call the constructor with different values
  Car carObj1("BMW", "X5", 1999);
  Car carObj2("Ford", "Mustang", 1969);

  // Print values
  cout << carObj1.brand << " " << carObj1.model << " " << carObj1.year << "\n";
  cout << carObj2.brand << " " << carObj2.model << " " << carObj2.year << "\n";
  return 0;
}


/*
In C++, there are three access specifiers:

public - members are accessible from outside the class
private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. 

by default its private if u dont specify
